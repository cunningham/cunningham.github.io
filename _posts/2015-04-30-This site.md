## This site

This site only exists as I wanted to have a place where I can exist on the internet that I have more control over.

I intend for it to have very infrequent posts and mostly just be a place that points people to my various accounts on the internet.  A **very** brief overview of how I make this site itself is below.


## Hosting
This site is hosted using Github's service called 'Github Pages'.  It allows me to basically host for free as long as my pages are all able to be static.

## Platform
Github Pages uses [JekyllRB](http://jekyllrb.com/) which turns plain text files in to a web site.  Simplicity is my friend.

## Domain Name
My domain name is from NameCheap.  NameCheap has given me no problems and their mobile app satisfies my need to sometimes buy novelty domains for kicks.

## Writing/Editing
Every part of the site is written in Markdown and converted with Jekyll in to a static set of pages.  I prefer Markdown because all of the formatting is done with plain text.  You can read about Markdown [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I stopped using Mou a while ago and generally just make edits in vim at this point.  My needs are so basic that nearly any GUI application is overkill.
