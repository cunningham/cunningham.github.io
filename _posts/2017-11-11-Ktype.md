## The K-type from [Input Club](http://input.club/)

I bought a [K-type] (https://input.club/k-type/) keyboard from Input club and am going to try and host some of my configs here.


## Primary config changes

Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/cunningham/673cf4e8869814ae20541e734a53c82e).  I don't change much, just prefer to have media and volume keys be dedicated instead of shortcuts.

I remap my caps lock, control, and command keys in their respective OSs rather than have those configs live in keyboard because I haven't figured out how to sort out the Windows vs. Mac way to do that.

## Animations

I find most of the animations built in are novel, but usually default back to blue with the underglow rainbow on top and bottom and red, green, and blue on the sides.

If I get super in to animations or something in the future I'll try to remember to host them and their gists here.
