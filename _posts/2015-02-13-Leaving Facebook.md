## "Leaving" Facebook

So I'm "leaving" Facebook.  I was mostly motivated by [this article](http://saintsal.com/facebook/), but that certainly isn't the only reason(See below).

Also, when I say I'm "leaving", I don't mean de-activating or deleting.  I'm sure that after some period of time, I will probably do that too, but I'm really just removing as much as I can, pinning this post to the top of my profile and never looking back.  I'll outline the way that I tore down my Facebook account at the bottom of this post if you are interested, but will for the most part just cover why I don't want to use it.  Also, I'll try to keep this up to date as I discover new and terrible things that happen as a result.

## Why?

I'll on privacy and a complete lack of respect for private data for now as the primary reasons, but in a lot of ways, I think that Facebook is really just actually a bad way to connect with people you know.  This [article](http://saintsal.com/facebook/) gives a pretty good breakdown of the privacy stuff, but I'll put my highlights here:

###Privacy

1: Maintenance of 'shadow profiles'([source](http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/)).  Basically, even if you don't give Facebook information, they will potentially get it from someone who knows you and they don't have to protect your privacy settings with that information.  Don't want to post your cell phone number on Facebook because you aren't comfortable giving them that information?  Too bad!  If any friend of yours either used the feature to find additional friends or synced their phones contacts(for example, built in Facebook sync on iOS), Facebook now has your phone number and can, more or less, do whatever they want with it.

2: Their use of so-called 'Snitching' to get data about you that they don't have to respect your privacy with.([Source](http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/) on this one isn't as laser specific, but it leads in to the next one.)

3: Posting ads that appear to be from me to my friends that I'm not notified about ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/01/21/facebook-is-recycling-your-likes-to-promote-stories-youve-never-seen-to-all-your-friends/)).  This is shitty for a lot of reasons, but the shittiest part of it is that they don't tell you and hide your friends reactions from your eyes to prevent you from knowing when it happens.


##Ramifications
I found out during the process that there are some things that happen as a result of tearing down your Facebook account, but they seem to be dominantly to do with how much you used your account throughout the internet.

###Facebook 'Platform'
Facebook Platform is that thing that lets you log in using your Facebook account in about a zillion places.  You might remember that once upon a time, Instagram(before being acquired by Facebook) required a Facebook account to set up your Instagram account.

Basically, removing Applications access has ramifications other than having to set up a new account.  I'll update the list below as I find more things.

| App/Service | |
| | |
| Spotify | Most all playlists disappeared.  Subscription settings gone.  **Update 2015/02/15** Along with my Spotify Unlimited subscription which has since been discontinued.  Shit.)  |
| Instagram | Seems to be for the most part unaffected, but I assume Facebook may have some voodoo keeping that connection alive.  I may have to remove that account and make a new one w/o Facebook.  |
| Misc. iOS | Most of the other apps I use are iOS apps that I used Facebook sign in for because I didn't have 1Password handy.  The few I still use just don't work at all and want me to sign up for a new account.|


##Tearing it down
Actually tearing down my Facebook account wasn't as bad as I thought.  I mostly wanted to change as much of my personally identifying information as I could and then remove as much history as possible to reduce the likelihood of the actual data being able to be inferred.

###Removing activity
The [Facebook Activity Remover](http://activityremover.com/) Chrome plug-in (available for Firefox as well.) pretty much took care of most of the things and was, if I remember correctly, $3.  Basically, install it, click a button, and it will start deleting everything you've done on Facebook(posts, comments, etc.).  There are free options like [Absterge](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/122073) and [Facebook Timeline Cleaner](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/151426), but I had trouble getting either to work reliably.

Given the privacy concerns I had with my data on Facebook, I thought it'd be a better idea to go through and actually delete and hide as much as possible before turning things off.

Once I got my activity removed, I had to go through and get rid of some stuff manually.  This was mostly just hiding things from my timeline because you can't delete a post someone else posted.  Likes ended up being a little weird and revealed that when an unofficial band page gets replaced by an official one, you end up 'Like-ing' them both and can only unlike the official one.

###Making my profile less complete
I also went through and removed most of my info from Facebook(at least as much as they let me.).  My birthday is now January 1st, 1900, I have no hometown, and I don't work.  It was really satisfying to keep returning to the Facebook home page and seeing, "Nicholas, your profile is 85% complete.", followed by, "Nicholas, your profile is only 50% complete.".

###Unfollow all the things
I couldn't find an automatic way to unfollow people, but once I was done, I got this beautiful shot of my news feed: ![no posts!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3B2o1p283y270k050y0Z/noposts.png "Find friends?  Not here I won't!")


##Conclusion
All in all, I'm not sure whether I'll stick with this, but it has been a really interesting exercise in seeing what all information a given service has on you.

Next time, I'll focus on this site and how difficult it is to convince people you have a personal web site/blog.
